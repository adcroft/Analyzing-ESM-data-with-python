A work in progress: this is the result of a project with some undergraduate interns to find and document the easiest way to load and analyze Earth System Model output.
It is also partly a brain dump resulting from my own investigation into best practices.

The idea is to interactively follow each jupyter notebook and you should start with the Introduction at https://github.com/adcroft/Analyzing-ESM-data-with-python/blob/master/1-Introduction.ipynb

For rendered HTML or PDF goto the [readthedocs.io site](https://analyzing-esm-data-with-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Todo:
- define pre-requisistes (python etc.)
- add pages on actual analysis!
  - integrals
  - evaluation of terms
  - time-series
