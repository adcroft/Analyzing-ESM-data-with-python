    "The point of these notes is to provide a crash course in using python to examine numerical Earth System Model (ESM) output. They are also an excuse to evaluate and compare various packages that you might find useful in their analysis of ESM output. These notes are _not a recommendation about which packages you should or should not use_. All packages have advantages and drawbacks and in my opinion are each are ideal for some tasks for which they were designed. Kudos to all the respective developers. I tend to use all the packages encountered in theses notes - I find being versatile helpful in what I do but you might prefer to choose one package for the comfort of familiarity."

    "Within a notebook, use the \"Run\" button to step through each cell and execute. \"CTRL-enter\" will also run the currently selected cell, while \"SHIFT-enter\" will do the same but then move and select the next cell."
